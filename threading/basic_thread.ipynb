    "\n",
    "1. The threads execute concurrently - their output is interleaved\n",
    "2. The CPU-intensive thread (`CPUThread`) tends to complete its calculations quickly because it doesn't have any sleep delays\n",
    "3. The other threads (`NumberThread`, `LetterThread`, `SymbolThread`) take longer because each has a 1-second sleep between operations\n",
