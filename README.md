# 📌 Python Concurrency Examples

Given that I've received questions regarding concurrency in python in a job interview for senior roles I'm now exploring different concurrency models in this repo: Threading, Multiprocessing, and Asyncio.

## 🏗 Repository Structure
- **threading/** – Examples using Python's built-in threading module.
- **multiprocessing/** – Demonstrates parallel execution using multiple processes.

## 🏃 How to Run
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-concurrency-examples.git
cd python-concurrency-examples
```

Install dependencies (if any):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a specific example:
```
python threading/basic_thread.py
```

## 🔥 What You'll Learn
+ Difference between concurrency and parallelism.
+ When to use threads, processes, or async.
+ Performance trade-offs between different concurrency models.
